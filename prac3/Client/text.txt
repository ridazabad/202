Two ways to view the world so similar at times

Two ways to rule the world to justify their crimes
By kings and queens young men are sent to die in war
Their propaganda speaks those words been heard before

Two ways to view the world brought Europe down in flames
Two ways to rule

Has man gone insane?
A few will remain
Who’ll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war
It spreads like disease,
There’s no sign of peace
Religion and creed
Cause millions to bleed
Three decades of war

From dawn
